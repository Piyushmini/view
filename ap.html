    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    <p>
        HTML stands for <b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).

        HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
    </p>
    <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>The opening tag</li>
        <li>The closing tag</li>
        <li>The actual element</li>
    </ol>
